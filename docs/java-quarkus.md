### Quarkus Java Project Template

## Overview
This document describes the files and structure of the Quarkus Java template provided by the `Craft` CLI tool. The template is designed to quickly set up a Java project using the Quarkus framework with essential configurations, Docker support, and scripts for streamlined development. This guide also explains how to start and develop the project inside a Docker container.

## How to Start the Project Using Docker

This template supports running the Quarkus application in a Docker container to ensure a consistent and isolated development environment. Follow the steps below to set up, build, and start the project.

---

### **Steps to Start the Project**

#### **1. Build and Start the Docker Environment**
Use the provided `docker-compose.dev.yml` file to create and start the development container.

- **Build the container:**
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
  ```

- **Start the container:**
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
  ```

- **Confirm the container is running:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  Look for a container named `PROJECT_NAME-quarkus-env`.

#### **2. Connect to the Development Container**
Once the container is running, connect to it for further development.

- **Open a bash session in the container:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -it PROJECT_NAME-quarkus-env bash
  ```

#### **3. Use the Makefile for Project Operations**
After connecting to the container, you can use the `Makefile` for common tasks such as building, running, and testing the application.

### **File Descriptions**

#### 1. **docker-compose.dev.yml**
- Configures a Dockerized development environment for the Quarkus application.
- Defines services, volumes, and dependencies for containerized development.

#### 2. **Dockerfile**
- Builds a Docker image for the Quarkus application.
- Configures the necessary runtime environment to run the application.

#### 3. **Makefile**
- Provides convenient shortcuts for common tasks.

#### 4. **mvnw / mvnw.cmd** *(Generated by Quarkus; can be removed)*
- These files allow building and running the project without requiring Maven to be installed locally. 
- **Note:** Since the project is designed to run exclusively in a Dockerized environment, these files are not necessary and can be removed to maintain consistency with the project's principles.

#### 5. **pom.xml** *(Generated by Quarkus)*
- The main Maven configuration file.
- Defines project dependencies, plugins, and build configurations.
- Preconfigured for Quarkus dependencies and setup.

#### 6. **src/** *(Generated by Quarkus)*
- Contains the source code for the application.
- Organize your application code under `src/main` and test code under `src/test`.

---

## Using the Makefile

The provided `Makefile` simplifies development tasks and is designed to be used within the Docker container:

- **Build the application**:
  ```bash
  make build
  ```
- **Run the application in development mode**:
  ```bash
  make dev
  ```
- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- **Package the application into an uber-jar**:
  ```bash
  make package
  ```

---

## Notes
- **Remove Maven Wrappers**: Since the project uses Docker for build and runtime environments, the `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` files can be removed to avoid the installation of Maven locally.

With this template, you can kick-start your Quarkus-based Java application development in a containerized environment with minimal setup effort. Modify and expand the project as needed to suit your application's requirements.
