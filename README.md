![Craft Logo](assets/logo.png)

## **Overview**

The `Craft` CLI is a tool designed to simplify the process of bootstrapping new projects by generating boilerplate code for various languages and frameworks. It ensures projects are configured to run seamlessly in Docker containers, enabling fast and consistent development environments. Whether you're working with Go, Java, or other supported languages, `Craft` helps you get started and maintain your projects efficiently.

## **Why Use Craft?**

- ### No Dependencies Required to run
  - Craft runs as a native binary, without needing to install additional languages or runtime environments.

- ### Built for Docker
  - All projects generated by Craft are preconfigured to work in **Docker containers** for seamless containerized development.
  - Explore new languages without the hassle of installing them locallyâ€”simply scaffold a project and start coding in a containerized environment.

- ### Minimalist Templates
  - Provides a clean starting point without excessive interconnected files.

- ### Fast Execution
  - Scaffolding and updates happen in seconds.

- ### Minimal and Straightforward
  - Craft provides a **basic starting point** for your projects. It avoids generating an overwhelming number of interconnected files, allowing you to build and structure your project the way you want.
- ### Cross-Language Support
  - Supports multiple languages like Go and Java, with more to come.

### **Fast Execution**: Scaffolding and updates happen in seconds.

## **Features**

- **Project Scaffolding** (`new` command):
  - Quickly generate project files and structure for supported languages and frameworks.
  - Embedded templates ensure a consistent starting point for new projects.

- **Project Updates** (`update` command):
  - Modify and maintain existing projects with additional boilerplate code or configuration updates.

- **Inspection** (`inspect` command):
  - View all allowed operations and their supported language/framework combinations.

- **Flexible Project Naming**:
  - Use the current directory name as the project name.
  - Specify a custom project name with a command-line flag.

- **Docker-Ready**:
  - Generated and updated projects are pre-configured to run in Docker containers.

## **Command Line Usage**

### **1. Creating New Projects**

Generate a new project by specifying the language:
```bash
craft new <language>
```

#### **Options**:
- `--name, -n`: Specify a name for the new project.
- `--current-dir-name, -c`: Use the current directory name for the project.

#### **Examples**:
1. Generate a Go project in the current directory:
   ```bash
   craft new go -c
   ```

2. Generate a new Java project with Maven in a directory named `MyJavaApp`:
   ```bash
   craft new java-maven-noframework -n MyJavaApp
   ```

3. View help for the `new` command:
   ```bash
   craft new --help
   ```

### **2. Updating Existing Projects**

Modify an existing project to include additional boilerplate or updated configuration:
```bash
craft update <language>
```

#### **Examples**:
1. Update a Java project with a specific framework:
   ```bash
   craft update java-maven-quarkus
   ```

2. Update a Go project:
   ```bash
   craft update go
   ```

3. View help for the `update` command:
   ```bash
   craft update --help
   ```

```bash
craft inspect
```

#### **Example**:
```bash
craft inspect
```
Example output:
```
Allowed Operations:
- new: go, java-maven-noframework
